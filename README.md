# BeHonest - Anonymous Messaging App

BeHonest is an anonymous messaging app developed in PHP that allows users to share chat conversation links and receive anonymous messages from anyone with the link. The recipient remains unaware of the sender's identity.

## How It Works

1. **Register:** Users need to register to use BeHonest's advanced features.
2. **Create Conversation:** Generate a unique chat conversation link.
3. **Share or Publish:** Share the link privately with specific recipients or publish it publicly on the web.
4. **Receive Messages:** Anyone with the link can respond anonymously to the conversation.
5. **Engage Anonymously:** Recipients can engage in anonymous conversations without knowing who the sender is.

## Installation
